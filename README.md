This sample demonstrates a few approaches for creating ChatGPT-like experiences over your own data using the Retrieval Augmented Generation pattern. It uses Azure OpenAI Service to access the ChatGPT model (gpt-35-turbo), and Azure AI Search for data indexing and retrieval.

The repo includes sample data so it's ready to try end to end. In this sample application we use a fictitious company called Contoso Electronics, and the experience allows its employees to ask questions about the benefits, internal policies, as well as job descriptions and roles.

![RAG Architecture](docs/appcomponents.png)

## Features

* Chat and Q&A interfaces
* Explores various options to help users evaluate the trustworthiness of responses with citations, tracking of source content, etc.
* Shows possible approaches for data preparation, prompt construction, and orchestration of interaction between model (ChatGPT) and retriever (AI Search)
* Settings directly in the UX to tweak the behavior and experiment with options
* Optional performance tracing and monitoring with Application Insights

![Chat screen](docs/chatscreen.png)

## Azure account requirements

**IMPORTANT:** In order to deploy and run this example, you'll need:

* **Azure account**. If you're new to Azure, [get an Azure account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-search/) and you'll get some free Azure credits to get started.
* **Azure subscription with access enabled for the Azure OpenAI service**. You can request access with [this form](https://aka.ms/oaiapply). If your access request to Azure OpenAI service doesn't match the [acceptance criteria](https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/limited-access?context=%2Fazure%2Fcognitive-services%2Fopenai%2Fcontext%2Fcontext), you can use [OpenAI public API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction) instead. Learn [how to switch to an OpenAI instance](#switching-from-an-azure-openai-endpoint-to-an-openai-instance).
* **Azure account permissions**:
  * Your Azure account must have `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` permissions, such as [Role Based Access Control Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#role-based-access-control-administrator-preview), [User Access Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator), or [Owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner). If you don't have subscription-level permissions, you must be granted [RBAC](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#role-based-access-control-administrator-preview) for an existing resource group and [deploy to that existing group](#existing-resource-group).
  * Your Azure account also needs `Microsoft.Resources/deployments/write` permissions on the subscription level.

## Azure deployment

### Cost estimation

Pricing varies per region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage.
However, you can try the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.com/e/8ffbe5b1919c4c72aed89b022294df76) for the resources below.

- Azure App Service: Basic Tier with 1 CPU core, 1.75 GB RAM. Pricing per hour. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/linux/)
- Azure OpenAI: Standard tier, ChatGPT and Ada models. Pricing per 1K tokens used, and at least 1K tokens are used per question. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/)
- Azure AI Document Intelligence: SO (Standard) tier using pre-built layout. Pricing per document page, sample documents have 261 pages total. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/form-recognizer/)
- Azure AI Search: Standard tier, 1 replica, free level of semantic search. Pricing per hour. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/search/)
- Azure Blob Storage: Standard tier with ZRS (Zone-redundant storage). Pricing per storage and read operations. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs/)
- Azure Monitor: Pay-as-you-go tier. Costs based on data ingested. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/)

To reduce costs, you can switch to free SKUs for Azure App Service and Azure AI Document Intelligence by changing the parameters file under the `infra` folder. There are some limits to consider; for example, the free Azure AI Document Intelligence resource only analyzes the first 2 pages of each document. You can also reduce costs associated with the Azure AI Document Intelligence by reducing the number of documents in the `data` folder, or by removing the postprovision hook in `azure.yaml` that runs the `prepdocs.py` script.

⚠️ To avoid unnecessary costs, remember to take down your app if it's no longer in use,
either by deleting the resource group in the Portal or running `azd down`.

### Project setup

You have a few options for setting up this project.
The easiest way to get started is GitHub Codespaces, since it will setup all the tools for you,
but you can also [set it up locally](#local-environment) if desired.

#### GitHub Codespaces

You can run this repo virtually by using GitHub Codespaces, which will open a web-based VS Code in your browser:

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=GitHub+Codespaces&message=Open&color=brightgreen&logo=github)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=599293758&machine=standardLinux32gb&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fdevcontainer.json&location=WestUs2)

#### VS Code Dev Containers

A related option is VS Code Dev Containers, which will open the project in your local VS Code using the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers):

1. Start Docker Desktop (install it if not already installed)
1. Open the project:
    [![Open in Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=Dev%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/azure-samples/azure-search-openai-demo)
1. In the VS Code window that opens, once the project files show up (this may take several minutes), open a terminal window
1. Run `azd auth login`
1. Now you can follow the instructions in [Deploying from scratch](#deploying-from-scratch) below

#### Local environment

First install the required tools:

* [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azure-dev/install)
* [Python 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  * **Important**: Python and the pip package manager must be in the path in Windows for the setup scripts to work.
  * **Important**: Ensure you can run `python --version` from console. On Ubuntu, you might need to run `sudo apt install python-is-python3` to link `python` to `python3`.
* [Node.js 14+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Powershell 7+ (pwsh)](https://github.com/powershell/powershell) - For Windows users only.
  * **Important**: Ensure you can run `pwsh.exe` from a PowerShell terminal. If this fails, you likely need to upgrade PowerShell.

Then bring down the project code:

1. Create a new folder and switch to it in the terminal
1. Run `azd auth login`
1. Run `azd init -t azure-search-openai-demo`
    * note that this command will initialize a git repository and you do not need to clone this repository

### Deploying from scratch

Execute the following command, if you don't have any pre-existing Azure services and want to start from a fresh deployment.

1. Run `azd up` - This will provision Azure resources and deploy this sample to those resources, including building the search index based on the files found in the `./data` folder.
    * **Important**: Beware that the resources created by this command will incur immediate costs, primarily from the AI Search resource. These resources may accrue costs even if you interrupt the command before it is fully executed. You can run `azd down` or delete the resources manually to avoid unnecessary spending.
    * You will be prompted to select two locations, one for the majority of resources and one for the OpenAI resource, which is currently a short list. That location list is based on the [OpenAI model availability table](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/models#model-summary-table-and-region-availability) and may become outdated as availability changes.
1. After the application has been successfully deployed you will see a URL printed to the console.  Click that URL to interact with the application in your browser.
It will look like the following:

!['Output from running azd up'](assets/endpoint.png)

> NOTE: It may take 5-10 minutes for the application to be fully deployed. If you see a "Python Developer" welcome screen or an error page, then wait a bit and refresh the page.

### Deploying with existing Azure resources

If you already have existing Azure resources, you can re-use those by setting `azd` environment values.

#### Existing resource group

1. Run `azd env set AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP {Name of existing resource group}`
1. Run `azd env set AZURE_LOCATION {Location of existing resource group}`

#### Existing OpenAI resource

##### Azure OpenAI:

1. Run `azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_SERVICE {Name of existing OpenAI service}`
1. Run `azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_RESOURCE_GROUP {Name of existing resource group that OpenAI service is provisioned to}`
1. Run `azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_CHATGPT_DEPLOYMENT {Name of existing ChatGPT deployment}`. Only needed if your ChatGPT deployment is not the default 'chat'.
1. Run `azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_EMB_DEPLOYMENT {Name of existing GPT embedding deployment}`. Only needed if your embeddings deployment is not the default 'embedding'.

When you run `azd up` after and are prompted to select a value for `openAiResourceGroupLocation`, make sure to select the same location as the existing OpenAI resource group.

##### Openai.com OpenAI:

1. Run `azd env set OPENAI_HOST openai`
2. Run `azd env set OPENAI_ORGANIZATION {Your OpenAI organization}`
3. Run `azd env set OPENAI_API_KEY {Your OpenAI API key}`
4. Run `azd up`

You can retrieve your OpenAI key by checking [your user page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and your organization by navigating to [your organization page](https://platform.openai.com/account/org-settings).
Learn more about creating an OpenAI free trial at [this link](https://openai.com/pricing).
Do *not* check your key into source control.

When you run `azd up` after and are prompted to select a value for `openAiResourceGroupLocation`, you can select any location as it will not be used.


#### Existing Azure AI Search resource

1. Run `azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE {Name of existing Azure AI Search service}`
1. Run `azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE_RESOURCE_GROUP {Name of existing resource group with ACS service}`
1. If that resource group is in a different location than the one you'll pick for the `azd up` step,
  then run `azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE_LOCATION {Location of existing service}`
1. If the search service's SKU is not standard, then run `azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE_SKU {Name of SKU}`. The free tier won't work as it doesn't support managed identity. If your existing search service is using the free tier, you will need to deploy a new service since [search SKUs cannot be changed](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-sku-tier#tier-upgrade-or-downgrade). ([See other possible SKU values](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/templates/microsoft.search/searchservices?pivots=deployment-language-bicep#sku))
1. If you have an existing index that is set up with all the expected fields, then run `azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX {Name of existing index}`. Otherwise, the `azd up` command will create a new index.

You can also customize the search service (new or existing) for non-English searches:

1. To configure the language of the search query to a value other than "en-US", run `azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_QUERY_LANGUAGE {Name of query language}`. ([See other possible values](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/preview-api/search-documents#queryLanguage))
1. To turn off the spell checker, run `azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_QUERY_SPELLER none`. Consult [this table](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/preview-api/search-documents#queryLanguage) to determine if spell checker is supported for your query language.
1. To configure the name of the analyzer to use for a searchable text field to a value other than "en.microsoft", run `azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_ANALYZER_NAME {Name of analyzer name}`. ([See other possible values](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.search.models.field.analyzer?view=azure-dotnet-legacy&viewFallbackFrom=azure-dotnet))

#### Other existing Azure resources

You can also use existing Azure AI Document Intelligence and Storage Accounts. See `./infra/main.parameters.json` for list of environment variables to pass to `azd env set` to configure those existing resources.

#### Provision remaining resources

Now you can run `azd up`, following the steps in [Deploying from scratch](#deploying-from-scratch) above.
That will both provision resources and deploy the code.


### Deploying again

If you've only changed the backend/frontend code in the `app` folder, then you don't need to re-provision the Azure resources. You can just run:

```azd deploy```

If you've changed the infrastructure files (`infra` folder or `azure.yaml`), then you'll need to re-provision the Azure resources. You can do that by running:

```azd up```


## Sharing environments

To give someone else access to a completely deployed and existing environment,
either you or they can follow these steps:

They will need the azd environment name, subscription ID, and location to run this command. You can find those values in your `.azure/{env name}/.env` file.  This will populate their azd environment's `.env` file with all the settings needed to run the app locally.
1. Set the environment variable `AZURE_PRINCIPAL_ID` either in that `.env` file or in the active shell to their Azure ID, which they can get with `az ad signed-in-user show`.
1. Run `./scripts/roles.ps1` or `.scripts/roles.sh` to assign all of the necessary roles to the user.  If they do not have the necessary permission to create roles in the subscription, then you may need to run this script for them. Once the script runs, they should be able to run the app locally.

## Enabling optional features

### Enabling Application Insights

To enable Application Insights and the tracing of each request, along with the logging of errors, set the `AZURE_USE_APPLICATION_INSIGHTS` variable to true before running `azd up`

1. Run `azd env set AZURE_USE_APPLICATION_INSIGHTS true`
1. Run `azd up`

To see the performance data, go to the Application Insights resource in your resource group, click on the "Investigate -> Performance" blade and navigate to any HTTP request to see the timing data.
To inspect the performance of chat requests, use the "Drill into Samples" button to see end-to-end traces of all the API calls made for any chat request:

![Tracing screenshot](docs/transaction-tracing.png)

To see any exceptions and server errors, navigate to the "Investigate -> Failures" blade and use the filtering tools to locate a specific exception. You can see Python stack traces on the right-hand side.

You can also see chart summaries on a dashboard by running the following command:

```shell
azd monitor
```

### Enabling authentication

By default, the deployed Azure web app will have no authentication or access restrictions enabled, meaning anyone with routable network access to the web app can chat with your indexed data.  You can require authentication to your Azure Active Directory by following the [Add app authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/scenario-secure-app-authentication-app-service) tutorial and set it up against the deployed web app.

To then limit access to a specific set of users or groups, you can follow the steps from [Restrict your Azure AD app to a set of users](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-restrict-your-app-to-a-set-of-users) by changing "Assignment Required?" option under the Enterprise Application, and then assigning users/groups access.  Users not granted explicit access will receive the error message -AADSTS50105: Your administrator has configured the application <app_name> to block users unless they are specifically granted ('assigned') access to the application.-

### Enabling login and document level access control

By default, the deployed Azure web app allows users to chat with all your indexed data. You can enable an optional login system using Azure Active Directory to restrict access to indexed data based on the logged in user. Enable the optional login and document level access control system by following [this guide](./LoginAndAclSetup.md).

### Enabling CORS for an alternate frontend

By default, the deployed Azure web app will only allow requests from the same origin.  To enable CORS for a frontend hosted on a different origin, run:

1. Run `azd env set ALLOWED_ORIGIN https://<your-domain.com>`
2. Run `azd up`

For the frontend code, change `BACKEND_URI` in `api.ts` to point at the deployed backend URL, so that all fetch requests will be sent to the deployed backend.

For an alternate frontend that's written in Web Components and deployed to Static Web Apps, check out
[azure-search-openai-javascript](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-javascript) and its guide
on [using a different backend](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-javascript#using-a-different-backend).

## Running locally

You can only run locally **after** having successfully run the `azd up` command. If you haven't yet, follow the steps in [Azure deployment](#azure-deployment) above.

1. Run `azd auth login`
2. Change dir to `app`
3. Run `./start.ps1` or `./start.sh` or run the "VS Code Task: Start App" to start the project locally.

## Using the app

* In Azure: navigate to the Azure WebApp deployed by azd. The URL is printed out when azd completes (as "Endpoint"), or you can find it in the Azure portal.
* Running locally: navigate to 127.0.0.1:50505

Once in the web app:

* Try different topics in chat or Q&A context. For chat, try follow up questions, clarifications, ask to simplify or elaborate on answer, etc.
* Explore citations and sources
* Click on "settings" to try different options, tweak prompts, etc.

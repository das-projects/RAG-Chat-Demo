# Nexible ChatBot

This app demonstrates a few approaches for creating ChatGPT-like experiences over your own data using the Retrieval Augmented Generation pattern. It uses Azure OpenAI Service to access the ChatGPT model (gpt-35-turbo), and Azure AI Search for data indexing and retrieval.

Just provide your own sample data, and you can have a fully deployed ChatBot with just one command!

## Features

* Chat and Q&A interfaces
* Explores various options to help users evaluate the trustworthiness of responses with citations, tracking of source content, etc.
* Shows possible approaches for data preparation, prompt construction, and orchestration of interaction between model (ChatGPT) and retriever (AI Search)
* Settings directly in the UX to tweak the behavior and experiment with options
* Performance tracing and monitoring with Application Insights

## Azure account requirements

**IMPORTANT:** In order to deploy and run this example, you'll need:

* **Azure subscription with access enabled for the Azure OpenAI service**. You can request access with [this form](https://aka.ms/oaiapply). If your access request to Azure OpenAI service doesn't match the [acceptance criteria](https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/limited-access?context=%2Fazure%2Fcognitive-services%2Fopenai%2Fcontext%2Fcontext), you can use [OpenAI public API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction) instead. Learn [how to switch to an OpenAI instance](#openaicom-openai).
* **Azure account permissions**:
  * Your Azure account must have `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` permissions, such as [Role Based Access Control Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#role-based-access-control-administrator-preview), [User Access Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator), or [Owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner). If you don't have subscription-level permissions, you must be granted [RBAC](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#role-based-access-control-administrator-preview) for an existing resource group and [deploy to that existing group](#existing-resource-group).
  * Your Azure account also needs `Microsoft.Resources/deployments/write` permissions on the subscription level.

### Cost estimation

Pricing varies per region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage.
However, you can try the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.com/e/8ffbe5b1919c4c72aed89b022294df76) for the resources below.

- Azure App Service: Basic Tier with 1 CPU core, 1.75 GB RAM. Pricing per hour. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/linux/)
- Azure OpenAI: Standard tier, ChatGPT and Ada models. Pricing per 1K tokens used, and at least 1K tokens are used per question. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/)
- Azure AI Document Intelligence: SO (Standard) tier using pre-built layout. Pricing per document page, sample documents have 261 pages total. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/form-recognizer/)
- Azure AI Search: Standard tier, 1 replica, free level of semantic search. Pricing per hour. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/search/)
- Azure Blob Storage: Standard tier with ZRS (Zone-redundant storage). Pricing per storage and read operations. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs/)
- Azure Monitor: Pay-as-you-go tier. Costs based on data ingested. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/)

⚠️ To avoid unnecessary costs, remember to take down your app if it's no longer in use,
either by deleting the resource group in the Portal or running `azd down`.

### Project setup

#### Local environment

First install the required tools:

* [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azure-dev/install)
* [Python 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  * **Important**: Python and the pip package manager must be in the path in Windows for the setup scripts to work.
  * **Important**: Ensure you can run `python --version` from console. On Ubuntu, you might need to run `sudo apt install python-is-python3` to link `python` to `python3`.
* [Node.js 14+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Powershell 7+ (pwsh)](https://github.com/powershell/powershell) - For Windows users only.
  * **Important**: Ensure you can run `pwsh.exe` from a PowerShell terminal. If this fails, you likely need to upgrade PowerShell.

Then bring down the project code:

1. Clone this repo
1. Run `azd auth login`
1. Run `azd init`
    * note that this command will initialize a git repository and you do not need to clone this repository

### Deploying from scratch

Execute the following command, if you don't have any pre-existing Azure services and want to start from a fresh deployment.

1. Run `azd up` - This will provision Azure resources and deploy this sample to those resources, including building the search index based on the files found in the `./data` folder.
1. After the application has been successfully deployed you will see a URL printed to the console.  Click that URL to interact with the application in your browser.
It will look like the following:

!['Output from running azd up'](docs/endpoint.png)

### Deploying with existing Azure resources

If you already have existing Azure resources, you can re-use those by setting `azd` environment values.

#### Existing resource group

1. Run `azd env set AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP {Name of existing resource group}`
1. Run `azd env set AZURE_LOCATION {Location of existing resource group}`

### Deploying again

If you've only changed the backend/frontend code in the `app` folder, then you don't need to re-provision the Azure resources. You can just run:

```azd deploy```

If you've changed the infrastructure files (`infra` folder or `azure.yaml`), then you'll need to re-provision the Azure resources. You can do that by running:

```azd up```

## Future Road Map

### Backend Access via Streamlit App

By adding backend access to the VectorDB via a Streamlit App, administrators would be able to drag and drop files, point to storage, and take care of technical setup to transform documents.

## Clean up

To clean up all the resources created by this sample:

1. Run `azd down`
2. When asked if you are sure you want to continue, enter `y`
3. When asked if you want to permanently delete the resources, enter `y`

The resource group and all the resources will be deleted.

### Cost estimation

- Azure App Service: Basic Tier with 1 CPU core, 1.75 GB RAM. Pricing per hour. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/linux/)
- Azure OpenAI: Standard tier, ChatGPT and Ada models. Pricing per 1K tokens used, and at least 1K tokens are used per question. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/)
- Form Recognizer: SO (Standard) tier using pre-built layout. Pricing per document page, sample documents have 261 pages total. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/form-recognizer/)
- Azure Cognitive Search: Standard tier, 1 replica, free level of semantic search. Pricing per hour.[Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/search/)
- Azure Blob Storage: Standard tier with ZRS (Zone-redundant storage). Pricing per storage and read operations. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs/)
- Azure Monitor: Pay-as-you-go tier. Costs based on data ingested. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/)

To reduce costs, you can switch to free SKUs for Azure App Service and Form Recognizer by changing the parameters file under the `infra` folder. There are some limits to consider; for example, the free Form Recognizer resource only analyzes the first 2 pages of each document. You can also reduce costs associated with the Form Recognizer by reducing the number of documents in the `data` folder, or by removing the postprovision hook in `azure.yaml` that runs the `prepdocs.py` script.

⚠️ To avoid unnecessary costs, remember to take down your app if it's no longer in use,
either by deleting the resource group in the Portal or running `azd down`.

### Project setup

First install the required tools:

* [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azure-dev/install)
* [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  * **Important**: Python and the pip package manager must be in the path in Windows for the setup scripts to work.
  * **Important**: Ensure you can run `python --version` from console. On Ubuntu, you might need to run `sudo apt install python-is-python3` to link `python` to `python3`.
* [Node.js 14+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Powershell 7+ (pwsh)](https://github.com/powershell/powershell) - For Windows users only.
  * **Important**: Ensure you can run `pwsh.exe` from a PowerShell terminal. If this fails, you likely need to upgrade PowerShell.

### Deployment:

1. Run `azd auth login`
2. Run `azd up` - This will provision Azure resources and deploy this sample to those resources, including building the search index based on the files found in the `./data` folder.

If you already have existing Azure resources and only code changes were made, you can re-use those by setting `azd` environment values and just call:
1. Run `azd deploy`

To see any exceptions and server errors, navigate to the "Investigate -> Failures" blade and use the filtering tools to locate a specific exception. You can see Python stack traces on the right-hand side.

### Enabling authentication

By default, the deployed Azure web app will have no authentication or access restrictions enabled, meaning anyone with routable network access to the web app can chat with your indexed data.  You can require authentication to your Azure Active Directory by following the [Add app authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/scenario-secure-app-authentication-app-service) tutorial and set it up against the deployed web app.

To then limit access to a specific set of users or groups, you can follow the steps from [Restrict your Azure AD app to a set of users](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-restrict-your-app-to-a-set-of-users) by changing "Assignment Required?" option under the Enterprise Application, and then assigning users/groups access.  Users not granted explicit access will receive the error message -AADSTS50105: Your administrator has configured the application <app_name> to block users unless they are specifically granted ('assigned') access to the application.-

### Enabling login and document level access control

By default, the deployed Azure web app allows users to chat with all your indexed data. You can enable an optional login system using Azure Active Directory to restrict access to indexed data based on the logged in user. Enable the optional login and document level access control system by following [this guide](./LoginAndAclSetup.md).

### Enabling CORS for an alternate frontend

By default, the deployed Azure web app will only allow requests from the same origin.  To enable CORS for a frontend hosted on a different origin, run:

1. Run `azd env set ALLOWED_ORIGIN https://<your-domain.com>`
2. Run `azd up`

For the frontend code, change `BACKEND_URI` in `api.ts` to point at the deployed backend URL, so that all fetch requests will be sent to the deployed backend.

For an alternate frontend that's written in Web Components and deployed to Static Web Apps, check out
[azure-search-openai-javascript](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-javascript) and its guide
on [using a different backend](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-javascript#using-a-different-backend).

## Running locally

You can only run locally **after** having successfully run the `azd up` command. If you haven't yet, follow the steps in [Azure deployment](#azure-deployment) above.

1. Run `azd auth login`
2. Change dir to `app`
3. Run `./start.ps1` or `./start.sh` or run the "VS Code Task: Start App" to start the project locally.

## Using the app

* In Azure: navigate to the Azure WebApp deployed by azd. The URL is printed out when azd completes (as "Endpoint"), or you can find it in the Azure portal.
* Running locally: navigate to 127.0.0.1:50505

Once in the web app:

* Try different topics in chat or Q&A context. For chat, try follow up questions, clarifications, ask to simplify or elaborate on answer, etc.
* Explore citations and sources
* Click on "settings" to try different options, tweak prompts, etc.

## Customizing the UI and data

Once you successfully deploy the app, you can start customizing it for your needs: changing the text, tweaking the prompts, and replacing the data. Consult the [app customization guide](docs/customization.md) as well as the [data ingestion guide](docs/data_ingestion.md) for more details.

## Productionizing

This sample is designed to be a starting point for your own production application,
but you should do a thorough review of the security and performance before deploying
to production. Read through our [productionizing guide](docs/productionizing.md) for more details.

## Resources

* [Revolutionize your Enterprise Data with ChatGPT: Next-gen Apps w/ Azure OpenAI and Cognitive Search](https://aka.ms/entgptsearchblog)

## Clean up

To clean up all the resources created by this sample:

1. Run `azd down`
2. When asked if you are sure you want to continue, enter `y`
3. When asked if you want to permanently delete the resources, enter `y`

The resource group and all the resources will be deleted.

### FAQ

<details><a id="compare-samples"></a>
<summary>How does this sample compare to other Chat with Your Data samples?</summary>

Another popular repository for this use case is here:
https://github.com/Microsoft/sample-app-aoai-chatGPT/

That repository is designed for use by customers using Azure OpenAI studio and Azure Portal for setup. It also includes `azd` support for folks who want to deploy it completely from scratch.

The primary differences:

* This repository includes multiple RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) approaches that chain the results of multiple API calls (to Azure OpenAI and ACS) together in different ways. The other repository uses only the built-in data sources option for the ChatCompletions API, which uses a RAG approach on the specified ACS index. That should work for most uses, but if you needed more flexibility, this sample may be a better option.
* This repository is also a bit more experimental in other ways, since it's not tied to the Azure OpenAI Studio like the other repository.

<details><a id="switch-gpt4"></a>
<summary>How do you use GPT-4 with this sample?</summary>

In `infra/main.bicep`, change `chatGptModelName` to 'gpt-4' instead of 'gpt-35-turbo'. You may also need to adjust the capacity above that line depending on how much TPM your account is allowed.
</details>

<details><a id="azd-up-explanation"></a>
<summary>What does the `azd up` command do?</summary>

The `azd up` command comes from the [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview), and takes care of both provisioning the Azure resources and deploying code to the selected Azure hosts.

The `azd up` command uses the `azure.yaml` file combined with the infrastructure-as-code `.bicep` files in the `infra/` folder. The `azure.yaml` file for this project declares several "hooks" for the prepackage step and postprovision steps. The `up` command first runs the `prepackage` hook which installs Node dependencies and builds the React.JS-based JavaScript files. It then packages all the code (both frontend and backend) into a zip file which it will deploy later.

Next, it provisions the resources based on `main.bicep` and `main.parameters.json`. At that point, since there is no default value for the OpenAI resource location, it asks you to pick a location from a short list of available regions. Then it will send requests to Azure to provision all the required resources. With everything provisioned, it runs the `postprovision` hook to process the local data and add it to an Azure Cognitive Search index.

Finally, it looks at `azure.yaml` to determine the Azure host (appservice, in this case) and uploads the zip to Azure App Service. The `azd up` command is now complete, but it may take another 5-10 minutes for the App Service app to be fully available and working, especially for the initial deploy.

Related commands are `azd provision` for just provisioning (if infra files change) and `azd deploy` for just deploying updated app code.

<details><a id="appservice-logs"></a>
<summary>How can we view logs from the App Service app?</summary>

You can view production logs in the Portal using either the Log stream or by downloading the default_docker.log file from Advanced tools.

The following line of code in `app/backend/app.py` configures the logging level:

```python
logging.basicConfig(level=os.getenv("APP_LOG_LEVEL", default_level))
```

To change the default level, either change `default_level` or set the `APP_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable
to one of the [allowed log levels](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging-levels):
`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`.

If you need to log in a route handler, use the the global variable `current_app`'s logger:

```python
async def chat():
    current_app.logger.info("Received /chat request")
```

Otherwise, use the `logging` module's root logger:

```python
logging.info("System message: %s", system_message)
```

If you're having troubles finding the logs in App Service, see this blog post on [tips for debugging App Service app deployments](http://blog.pamelafox.org/2023/06/tips-for-debugging-flask-deployments-to.html) or watch [this video about viewing App Service logs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0-aYuvws54).

### Troubleshooting

Here are the most common failure scenarios and solutions:

1. The subscription (`AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`) doesn't have access to the Azure OpenAI service. Please ensure `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` matches the ID specified in the [OpenAI access request process](https://aka.ms/oai/access).

1. You're attempting to create resources in regions not enabled for Azure OpenAI (e.g. East US 2 instead of East US), or where the model you're trying to use isn't enabled. See [this matrix of model availability](https://aka.ms/oai/models).

1. You've exceeded a quota, most often number of resources per region. See [this article on quotas and limits](https://aka.ms/oai/quotas).

1. You're getting "same resource name not allowed" conflicts. That's likely because you've run the sample multiple times and deleted the resources you've been creating each time, but are forgetting to purge them. Azure keeps resources for 48 hours unless you purge from soft delete. See [this article on purging resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/manage-resources?tabs=azure-portal#purge-a-deleted-resource).

1. You see `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` when the `prepdocs.py` script runs. That's typically due to incorrect SSL certificates setup on your machine. Try the suggestions in this [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35569042/ssl-certificate-verify-failed-with-python3/43855394#43855394).

1. After running `azd up` and visiting the website, you see a '404 Not Found' in the browser. Wait 10 minutes and try again, as it might be still starting up. Then try running `azd deploy` and wait again. If you still encounter errors with the deployed app, consult these [tips for debugging App Service app deployments](http://blog.pamelafox.org/2023/06/tips-for-debugging-flask-deployments-to.html) or watch [this video about downloading App Service logs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0-aYuvws54). Please file an issue if the logs don't help you resolve the error.

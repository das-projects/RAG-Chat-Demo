# Nexible Chatbot with Azure OpenAI and Cognitive Search



This prototype demonstrates the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern. It uses Azure OpenAI Service to access the 
ChatGPT model (gpt-35-turbo), the ada-002 text embedding model, and Azure Cognitive Search for data indexing and retrieval.

![RAG Architecture](docs/high_level_data_flow.png)

## Features

* Chat interface with citations and source content tracking.
* Implements Chain of Thought model for RAG chat. ReACT [arXiv:2210.03629] and MKRL [arXiv:2205.00445] approaches are in active development.

### Cost estimation

- Azure App Service: Basic Tier with 1 CPU core, 1.75 GB RAM. Pricing per hour. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/linux/)
- Azure OpenAI: Standard tier, ChatGPT and Ada models. Pricing per 1K tokens used, and at least 1K tokens are used per question. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/)
- Azure AI Document Intelligence: SO (Standard) tier using pre-built layout. Pricing per document page, sample documents have 261 pages total. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/form-recognizer/)
- Azure AI Search: Standard tier, 1 replica, free level of semantic search. Pricing per hour.[Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/search/)
- Azure Blob Storage: Standard tier with ZRS (Zone-redundant storage). Pricing per storage and read operations. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs/)
- Azure Monitor: Pay-as-you-go tier. Costs based on data ingested. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/)

To reduce costs, you can switch to free SKUs for Azure App Service and Azure AI Document Intelligence by changing the parameters file under the `infra` folder. There are some limits to consider; for example, the free Azure AI Document Intelligence resource only analyzes the first 2 pages of each document. You can also reduce costs associated with the Azure AI Document Intelligence by reducing the number of documents in the `data` folder, or by removing the postprovision hook in `azure.yaml` that runs the `prepdocs.py` script.

⚠️ To avoid unnecessary costs, remember to take down your app if it's no longer in use,
either by deleting the resource group in the Portal or running `azd down`.

### Project setup

First install the required tools:

* [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azure-dev/install)
* [Python 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  * **Important**: Python and the pip package manager must be in the path in Windows for the setup scripts to work.
  * **Important**: Ensure you can run `python --version` from console. On Ubuntu, you might need to run `sudo apt install python-is-python3` to link `python` to `python3`.
* [Node.js 14+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Powershell 7+ (pwsh)](https://github.com/powershell/powershell) - For Windows users only.
  * **Important**: Ensure you can run `pwsh.exe` from a PowerShell terminal. If this fails, you likely need to upgrade PowerShell.

### Deployment:

1. Run `azd auth login`
2. Run `azd up` - This will provision Azure resources and deploy this sample to those resources, including building the search index based on the files found in the `./data` folder.

> NOTE: It may take 5-10 minutes for the application to be fully deployed. If you see a "Python Developer" welcome screen or an error page, then wait a bit and refresh the page.

### Deploying with existing Azure resources

If you already have existing Azure resources, you can re-use those by setting `azd` environment values.

#### Existing resource group

1. Run `azd env set AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP {Name of existing resource group}`
1. Run `azd env set AZURE_LOCATION {Location of existing resource group}`

#### Existing OpenAI resource

##### Azure OpenAI:

1. Run `azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_SERVICE {Name of existing OpenAI service}`
1. Run `azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_RESOURCE_GROUP {Name of existing resource group that OpenAI service is provisioned to}`
1. Run `azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_CHATGPT_DEPLOYMENT {Name of existing ChatGPT deployment}`. Only needed if your ChatGPT deployment is not the default 'chat'.
1. Run `azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_EMB_DEPLOYMENT {Name of existing GPT embedding deployment}`. Only needed if your embeddings deployment is not the default 'embedding'.

When you run `azd up` after and are prompted to select a value for `openAiResourceGroupLocation`, make sure to select the same location as the existing OpenAI resource group.

##### Openai.com OpenAI:

1. Run `azd env set OPENAI_HOST openai`
2. Run `azd env set OPENAI_ORGANIZATION {Your OpenAI organization}`
3. Run `azd env set OPENAI_API_KEY {Your OpenAI API key}`
4. Run `azd up`

You can retrieve your OpenAI key by checking [your user page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and your organization by navigating to [your organization page](https://platform.openai.com/account/org-settings).
Learn more about creating an OpenAI free trial at [this link](https://openai.com/pricing).
Do *not* check your key into source control.

When you run `azd up` after and are prompted to select a value for `openAiResourceGroupLocation`, you can select any location as it will not be used.


#### Existing Azure Cognitive Search resource

1. Run `azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE {Name of existing Azure Cognitive Search service}`
1. Run `azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE_RESOURCE_GROUP {Name of existing resource group with ACS service}`
1. If that resource group is in a different location than the one you'll pick for the `azd up` step,
  then run `azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE_LOCATION {Location of existing service}`
1. If the search service's SKU is not standard, then run `azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE_SKU {Name of SKU}`. The free tier won't work as it doesn't support managed identity. ([See other possible values](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/templates/microsoft.search/searchservices?pivots=deployment-language-bicep#sku))
1. If you have an existing index that is set up with all the expected fields, then run `azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX {Name of existing index}`. Otherwise, the `azd up` command will create a new index.

You can also customize the search service (new or existing) for non-English searches:

1. To configure the language of the search query to a value other than "en-us", run `azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_QUERY_LANGUAGE {Name of query language}`. ([See other possible values](https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-search-documents/azure.search.documents.models.querylanguage?view=azure-python-preview))
1. To turn off the spell checker, run `azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_QUERY_SPELLER none`. ([See other possible values](https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-search-documents/azure.search.documents.models.queryspellertype?view=azure-python-preview))
1. To configure the name of the analyzer to use for a searchable text field to a value other than "en.microsoft", run `azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_ANALYZER_NAME {Name of analyzer name}`. ([See other possible values](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.search.models.field.analyzer?view=azure-dotnet-legacy&viewFallbackFrom=azure-dotnet))

#### Other existing Azure resources

You can also use existing Form Recognizer and Storage Accounts. See `./infra/main.parameters.json` for list of environment variables to pass to `azd env set` to configure those existing resources.

#### Provision remaining resources

Now you can run `azd up`, following the steps in [Deploying from scratch](#deploying-from-scratch) above.
That will both provision resources and deploy the code.


### Deploying again

If you've only changed the backend/frontend code in the `app` folder, then you don't need to re-provision the Azure resources. You can just run:

```azd deploy```

If you've changed the infrastructure files (`infra` folder or `azure.yaml`), then you'll need to re-provision the Azure resources. You can do that by running:

```azd up```


## Sharing environments

To give someone else access to a completely deployed and existing environment,
either you or they can follow these steps:

They will need the azd environment name, subscription ID, and location to run this command. You can find those values in your `.azure/{env name}/.env` file.  This will populate their azd environment's `.env` file with all the settings needed to run the app locally.
1. Set the environment variable `AZURE_PRINCIPAL_ID` either in that `.env` file or in the active shell to their Azure ID, which they can get with `az ad signed-in-user show`.
1. Run `./scripts/roles.ps1` or `.scripts/roles.sh` to assign all of the necessary roles to the user.  If they do not have the necessary permission to create roles in the subscription, then you may need to run this script for them. Once the script runs, they should be able to run the app locally.

## Enabling optional features

### Enabling Application Insights

To enable Application Insights and the tracing of each request, along with the logging of errors, set the `AZURE_USE_APPLICATION_INSIGHTS` variable to true before running `azd up`

1. Run `azd env set AZURE_USE_APPLICATION_INSIGHTS true`
1. Run `azd up`

To see the performance data, go to the Application Insights resource in your resource group, click on the "Investigate -> Performance" blade and navigate to any HTTP request to see the timing data.
To inspect the performance of chat requests, use the "Drill into Samples" button to see end-to-end traces of all the API calls made for any chat request:

![Tracing screenshot](docs/transaction-tracing.png)

To see any exceptions and server errors, navigate to the "Investigate -> Failures" blade and use the filtering tools to locate a specific exception. You can see Python stack traces on the right-hand side.

You can also see chart summaries on a dashboard by running the following command:

```shell
azd monitor
```

### Enabling authentication

By default, the deployed Azure web app will have no authentication or access restrictions enabled, meaning anyone with routable network access to the web app can chat with your indexed data.  You can require authentication to your Azure Active Directory by following the [Add app authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/scenario-secure-app-authentication-app-service) tutorial and set it up against the deployed web app.

To then limit access to a specific set of users or groups, you can follow the steps from [Restrict your Azure AD app to a set of users](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-restrict-your-app-to-a-set-of-users) by changing "Assignment Required?" option under the Enterprise Application, and then assigning users/groups access.  Users not granted explicit access will receive the error message -AADSTS50105: Your administrator has configured the application <app_name> to block users unless they are specifically granted ('assigned') access to the application.-

### Enabling login and document level access control

By default, the deployed Azure web app allows users to chat with all your indexed data. You can enable an optional login system using Azure Active Directory to restrict access to indexed data based on the logged in user. Enable the optional login and document level access control system by following [this guide](./LoginAndAclSetup.md).

## Running locally

You can only run locally **after** having successfully run the `azd up` command. If you haven't yet, follow the steps in [Azure deployment](#azure-deployment) above.

1. Run `azd auth login`
2. Change dir to `app`
3. Run `./start.ps1` or `./start.sh` or run the "VS Code Task: Start App" to start the project locally.

## Using the app

* In Azure: navigate to the Azure WebApp deployed by azd. The URL is printed out when azd completes (as "Endpoint"), or you can find it in the Azure portal.
* Running locally: navigate to 127.0.0.1:50505

Once in the web app:

* Try different topics in chat or Q&A context. For chat, try follow up questions, clarifications, ask to simplify or elaborate on answer, etc.
* Explore citations and sources
* Click on "settings" to try different options, tweak prompts, etc.
